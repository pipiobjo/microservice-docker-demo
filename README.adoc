= microservice-docker-demo

The aproach of this project is to demonstrate how microservices can be build. 

Starting with a simple application and build step by step a complex infrastructure on top of it
The application and infrastructure components should containerized even during development


Chapters:

1. Provide a simple business application (helloWorldApp)

    1.1. Dockerize the simple Application

1.2 Development and deployment within the docker container

2. Provide a second business application (motdApp)
