= microservice-docker-demo

The aproach of this project is to demonstrate how microservices can be build. 

Starting with a simple application and build step by step a complex infrastructure on top of it
The application and infrastructure components should containerized even during development


Chapters:

1. Provide a simple business application (helloWorldApp)

    1.1. Dockerize the simple Application

1.2 Development and deployment within the docker container

2. Provide a second business application (motdApp)



= Artefacts

include::file://./backend-services/helloWorldApp/.adoc[Provide a simple helloWorldApp] to show how rest services could be created and tested




= Artefact initialisation

* Spring Boot Artefact init via https://start.spring.io/
* Gradle gradle-4.10.2
* https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/using-boot-devtools.html[Spring Boot Devtool] for automated restarts, we need them for docker https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/using-boot-devtools.html#using-boot-devtools-remote[remote deployment]
* Using for request logging       <!-- request tracing id -->
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-sleuth</artifactId>
        </dependency>

* JMX https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/3.2.x/spring-framework-reference/html/jmx.html



= Next Learning Steps

== Development of backend services

* Provide your own business service maybe a "message of the day" service
* Provide a docker-compose setup for your environment
* Provide a single entry point (webgateway) to consume both of your services
* Provide a security context
** Consider a stateless security context to all business service calls
** Provide multiple user roles
** Provide a mechanism for easy role checks in your dev environment
** Try to use keycloak as docker container in your environment
** Provide AuthEndpoints for a social media network
* Provide a monitoring environment
** Consider long-term monitoring with persistence
* Provide a logging environment
** Consider requestIds / tracingIds (sleuth)
* Scale things up
** Provide multiple instances of every service
** Consider that scaling the webgateway, results in different IPs
** Consider that the auth state has to be shared with the other webgateway instances (redis)
*** Is there a way to use virtual ips in docker, for a developer setup?


== Development of frontend services

* Provide a microfrontend infrastructure
** Checkout https://micro-frontends.org/
* Provide a Frontend containing multiple UI Frameworks for example Angular and Vuejs


== Deployment / Runtime

* Provide a cloud setup
** provide a configuration setup
** dynamic scaling of your microservice
** check kubernetes / docker swarm
